# neuro-lab
A general neural network model with variable configuration to experiment on for image recognition, speech recognition  e.t.c

Easily experiment on different architectures {input(features) nodes, no of hidden layers and output nodes} and training parameters i.e lambda, no of iterations (epoch number) e.t.c
